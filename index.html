        <h2>what is web development?</h2>
        <p>
         The first question we have to ask ourselves 
         is what is web development?How do you start 
         this journey ? Well, web development is building 
         websites and deploying web pages on the web.Thats
         my understanding.A journey of  developing a web 
         cant be completed only by building the website,
         you also need to deploy it.
         What is a website then? A collection of various
         pages written in a scripting language.There some
         common terms involved in building webs.
         <a href="https//:www.google.com">HTTP</a>
         <a href="https//:www.google.com">SMTP</a>
         <a href="https//:www.google.com">DNS</a>
         <a href="https//:www.google.com">FTP</a>
         <a href="https//:www.google.com">Hyperlinks</a>
         and so on.
        </p>
        <h3>HOW A WEBSITE WORKS</h3>
        <p>
            What is really needed for a web to work: yourPC(where
             you will see the web),A web browser(software which helps 
             to browse the web)eg chrome,firefox,microsoft edge etc,An
             internet connection(provided by an ISP and connects you to
             the internet to reach any web), a web server(where website is hosted).
             For easier explanation we shall look at an example. When you type WWW.Zetech.ac.ke, the request goes to one special computer known as Domain Name Server (DNS).All routers are routed through various routers and switches.
The DNS keeps names and their IP addresses , so when WWW.Zetech.ac.ke is typed it gets translated into a number which identifies the computer that serves Zetech website to you.
As you enter URL (Uniform Resource Locator) into a web browser (Zetech.ac.ke).This request is passed to a DNS.DNS returns an IP adress for the server that hosts the server.
The browser requests the page from the web server used by the IP address specified by the DNS.
The webserver returns the page the page to the IP address specified by the browser requesting the page.
The browser collects all information and displays to your computer inform of web pages.
